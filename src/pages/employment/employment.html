  <h1>EMPLOYMENT</h1>
  <p>LFS provides each refugee with a career counselor who searches for possible jobs and helps to provide job orientation and training. These specialists are responsible for many families, so they can always use help!</p>
  <p>Helping refugees building resumes, practicing interviews, and understanding American employee etiquette are some ways you can help!</p>

  <h1>7 things you can do</h1>
  <li>Discuss what are some things a refugee can do to become employed. Ask if one knows what LFS is doing to help him or her become employed. Find out what one is doing for oneâ€™s self to become employed. If he or she does not know, suggest that one
  make a meeting with his or her career counselor. Also, write down his or her career counselor's name and phone number.</li>
  <li>Talk about how to do well in an interview. Practice! Practice! Practice!</li>
